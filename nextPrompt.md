The note saving feature does not really work. When a user adds a note, it gets saved to firebase, and there's only one post but there is somehow 2exactly identical notes displaying in the note page. And if i delete the collection in firebase, both notes are still displaying in notes page. Even if deleted from webbrowser cache the notes. 
However when i login in a inkognito browser, the notes are not displayed.
