When a timercombination ends all its cycle, it stops at 0:01 (one second). Make it stop at 0:00 (zero seconds). Also remove the the boxes in portion in top where it says number of active, number of completed and time  

Have a section in bottom under active timers where you can see all your timercombinations that is already finished. Så as soon as a timer is finished and the user has reloads a page, move the timer to the finished section. Also before the user reloads the page change the play/pause button to move to the finished section. Have the say 'Archive' instead of 'Play' and 'Pause'.
